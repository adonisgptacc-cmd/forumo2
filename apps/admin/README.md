# Admin Console

The admin experience will reuse the Next.js runtime from `apps/web` but with its own route group and RBAC guards. Key surfaces include:

- KYC queue with SLA timers
- Listing moderation panel with AI scores
- Escrow dispute workflows
- Fraud/risk dashboard and trust score overrides

Implementation will begin once the shared design system ships.
